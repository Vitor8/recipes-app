    - When scrolling down, when the user clicks on the 'Start Recipe' button, a new page is rendered, with the step-by-step instructions for making the recipe.
  
    - By clicking on the ingredients checkbox, the information is saved in Local Storage. So, when the user returns to the different initialized food and beverage recipes, the user starts where he left off.
